# Neuro-Inclusivity

This design system is built with neurodiverse users in mind. It aims to create interfaces that are inclusive and considerate of various cognitive needs.

## Principles

- **Simplicity**: Keep interfaces simple and uncluttered to reduce cognitive load.
- **Consistency**: Use consistent layouts, colors, and components to help users predict how to interact with the UI.
- **Flexibility**: Allow users to customize their experience, such as adjusting text size or switching to a high-contrast mode.
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear, concise instructions and feedback to guide users through tasks.

## Resources

- **The A11Y Project**: A community-driven effort to make digital accessibility easier.
- **Neurodiverse Design**: Resources and articles on designing for neurodiversity.

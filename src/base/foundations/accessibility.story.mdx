# Accessibility

Ensuring accessibility in this design system is a core principle. My goal is to make the components usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities.

## Guidelines

- **Semantic HTML**: Use HTML elements according to their intended purpose to improve the accessibility and SEO of your web content.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements can be navigated using a keyboard.
- **Color Contrast**: Use sufficient color contrast between text and background to make the content readable for everyone, including people with visual impairments.
- **ARIA Roles and Attributes**: Use ARIA roles and attributes to provide additional information about the behavior and purpose of interface elements.

## Tools

- **axe**: A browser extension for accessibility testing.
- **Lighthouse**: An open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages.
- **WAVE**: A web accessibility evaluation tool.

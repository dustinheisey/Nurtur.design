# Sustainability

Environmental sustainability is a core principle of our design system. We aim to reduce our ecological footprint through thoughtful design and development practices.

## Practices

- **Energy Efficiency**: Optimize code and resources to minimize energy consumption.
- **Minimalist Design**: Avoid unnecessary elements and features that could increase resource usage.
- **Sustainable Hosting**: Use green hosting providers that prioritize renewable energy sources.
- **Reusability**: Design components that can be reused across multiple projects to reduce waste.

## Tools

- **Green Web Foundation**: Provides a directory of green hosting providers.
- **Eco-Friendly Design**: Resources and guidelines for creating environmentally sustainable designs.
